    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>2 cups pumpkin puree (fresh or canned)</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk (or regular cream)</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional garnishes: fresh parsley, pumpkin seeds, swirl of coconut milk or cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the Aromatics: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the Vegetables: Add the diced potatoes and stir to coat them with the oil and aromatics. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add Pumpkin and Broth: Stir in the pumpkin puree, vegetable broth, dried thyme, and nutmeg. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 20–25 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li>Blend the Soup: Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, carefully transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until creamy. Return the soup to the pot if using a blender.</li>
        <li>Add the Cream: Stir in the coconut milk or regular cream and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed. Let the soup heat through on low for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley, pumpkin seeds, or a swirl of coconut milk for a decorative touch.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, alongside crusty bread or a side salad, for a satisfying meal.</li>
    </ol>
