    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Asian-style tofu dish is a quick, delicious, and protein-packed meal with a delightful blend of savory, sweet, and slightly spicy flavors. Marinated in a soy-ginger sauce, the tofu absorbs a delicious mix of umami flavors and gains a crisp, golden-brown exterior when pan-fried. Tossed with sautéed vegetables like bell peppers and snap peas, this dish is vibrant and versatile, perfect for serving over rice or noodles. It's a fantastic weeknight meal that’s satisfying and easily customizable with any favorite veggies.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 block (14 oz) firm tofu, drained and cubed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp maple syrup (or honey)</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup snap peas</li>
        <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro or basil, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Press the Tofu: Place the tofu on a plate lined with paper towels, add another layer of paper towels on top, and press gently with a weight (like a heavy pan) for 10–15 minutes to remove excess water. This will help it crisp up better when cooking.</li>
        <li>Make the Marinade: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, maple syrup, minced garlic, and grated ginger.</li>
        <li>Marinate the Tofu: Place the cubed tofu in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Gently toss to coat all pieces. Let the tofu marinate for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure even flavor absorption.</li>
        <li>Cook the Tofu: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes (reserving the marinade) and cook for about 3–4 minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy. Remove the tofu from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Vegetables: In the same skillet, add the sliced bell peppers and snap peas, cooking for about 3–4 minutes until they are crisp-tender.</li>
        <li>Combine and Finish: Return the tofu to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour the reserved marinade over everything and stir gently to coat, cooking for an additional 1–2 minutes until the sauce slightly thickens and coats the tofu and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Transfer the tofu and vegetable mixture to a serving plate. Garnish with green onion, sesame seeds, and fresh cilantro or basil if desired. Serve hot over steamed rice or noodles for a complete meal.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Dig in while it’s warm and flavorful!</li>
